How to start the server (testing):
This was made using Visual Studio Code, so assuming you are using that or something similar on a windows machine...

-enable scripts by going into an admin powershell terminal and type "Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted"
-go into visual studio code, open the terminal
-change your current directory to backend
-type in "npm install -g nodemon"
-after it installs, and while still in the backend directory, type "nodemon server"
-if it says:
"Server is running on port: 3000
MongoDB database connection established successfully"
we should be good. (press ctrl + c to exit nodemon)
